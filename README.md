# Dev Day workshop

This repository contains a .NET Web API to serve as training material.

There are endpoints for:

- Customers
- Products
- Orders

Open the solution in Visual Studio or in VS Code. When running it, a web browser window will open with the Swagger UI where you can experiment with calls to the endpoints.
